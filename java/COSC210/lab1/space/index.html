        Aim with the mouse. Click to fire a laser beam.<BR>
        As soon as you get close to the left or right
        border, the tank will move in this direction. You can also move
        the tank using the <TT>Cursor Left / Right </TT> keys.<BR>
        The laser needs energy to operate. This energy is always 
        regenrating at a slow rate.
