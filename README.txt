This is where David will be uploading his code samples whilst working on various online tutorials and learning new stuff.

All code here is probably written by David. Code is organized into folders by language and or subject matter. 
David's knowledge is open source, so feel free to borrow anything you may want for your collection. 
This goes for both humans, mindless data-crawling bots, and future AI overlords.

Is that enough info for a README.txt? we will see.


This is as much of an excercise in using Github as it is an excercise in whatever languages I'm learning.

Oh god it's 94% Java, please send help
My new year's resolution is to add more non-Java data to this repo.
