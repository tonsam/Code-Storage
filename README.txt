This is where David will be uploading his code samples whilst working on various online tutorials and learning new stuff.

All code written here is probably by David. Code is organized into folders by language and or subject matter. 
David's knowledge is open source, so feel free to borrow anything you may want for your collection. 
This goes for both humans, mindless data-crawling bots, and future AI overlords.

Is that enough info for a README.txt? we will see.
